_Still a work in progress_

```{r setup}
library(threesixtygiving)
```



## Retrieve all grants

```{r retrieve-grants, eval=FALSE}
grants <- tsg_all_grants(timeout = 8, retries = 1)
```

```{r save-grants, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(readr)

write_rds(grants, "vignettes/grants.rds")

```



## Core data

`tsg_all_grants` returns a list of tibbles, due to differences in the data provided by each funder. `tsg_core_data` returns a tibble with the 10 columns in the [360Giving Open Standard](https://standard.threesixtygiving.org/en/latest/#), plus the publisher prefix used to identify each funder. In the case below I have converted non-GBP currencies to GBP on the rates on 2019-10-24.

```{r read-in-grant-rds, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(readr)

grants <- read_rds("vignettes/grants.rds")
```


```{r core-data, eval=FALSE}

library(dplyr)

df <- tsg_core_data(grants)

df2 <- df %>% 
  mutate(amount_awarded = case_when(
    currency == "USD" ~ amount_awarded/1.29, ## rate on 2019-10-24
    currency == "CAD" ~ amount_awarded/1.69, 
    currency == "CHF" ~ amount_awarded/1.28, 
    currency == "EUR" ~ amount_awarded/1.16,
    TRUE ~ amount_awarded)) %>%
  group_by(funding_org_name) %>%
  summarise(n = n(),
            amount_awarded = sum(amount_awarded)) %>%
  mutate(avg = amount_awarded/n)

In the the plot below I've highlighted funders that make very many or very few grants, and that are either very large or very small.

### Award sizes

In the two examples below, we can see differences between the amount of money applied for and the amount awarded. Not every funder reports the amount applied for, and some report what seem like placeholder values, such as grant programmes where applicants do not need to specify the value of the grant, only what they want to do and leave the award amount up to the funder. 

```{r award-differences, eval=FALSE}
proc_df <- tsg_process_data(grants) 

proc_amount_df <- proc_df  %>% 
  select(identifier, title, description, funding_org_name,
         amount_awarded, amount_applied_for) %>%
  mutate_at(.vars = vars(amount_awarded, amount_applied_for), as.numeric) %>% 
  mutate(difference = amount_awarded-amount_applied_for,
         percentage_of = amount_awarded/amount_applied_for) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(amount_applied_for), amount_applied_for > 2500,
         amount_awarded > 2500,
         percent_rank(difference) >= 0.02 &
           percent_rank(difference) <= 0.98) %>% ## remove outliers
  mutate(difference = round(difference))

count0 <- proc_amount_df %>%
  filter(difference==0) %>%
  tally()
  
p4 <- ggplot(proc_amount_df %>% filter(difference != 0),
             aes(x = difference)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(bins = 100) + 
  geom_label_repel(
    aes(x = 0, y = 4000,
        label = paste0(scales::comma(n),

### Systemic change funders


Organisations that are focused on systemic change and policy-influencing seem to be particularly reliant on trusts and foundations for income, as their work is harder to sell to ordinary members of the public motivated by emotional connections with an issue, and see their money going to directly help an identifiable person.


```{r eval=FALSE}

                         contains("classificat")),
            .vars_predicate = any_vars(
              str_detect(., regex('strategy|strategic|systemic', 
                                  ignore_case=TRUE))

            n= n())
