## Retrieve all grants

```{r retrieve-grants, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
grants <- tsg_all_grants(timeout = 8, retries = 1)
```


## Core data

`tsg_all_grants` returns a list of tibbles, due to differences in the data provided by each funder. `tsg_core_data` returns a tibble with the 10 columns in the [360Giving Open Standard](https://standard.threesixtygiving.org/en/latest/#), plus the publisher prefix used to identify each funder. In the case below I have converted non-GBP currencies to GBP on the rates on 2019-10-24.

``` {r core-data, eval=FALSE}
library(purrr)
library(dplyr)

df <- tsg_core_data(grants)

df2 <- df %>% 
  mutate(amount_awarded = case_when(
    currency == "USD" ~ amount_awarded/1.29, ## rate on 2019-10-24
    currency == "CAD" ~ amount_awarded/1.69, 
    currency == "CHF" ~ amount_awarded/1.28, 
    currency == "EUR" ~ amount_awarded/1.16,
    TRUE ~ amount_awarded)) %>%
  group_by(funding_org_name) %>%
  summarise(n = n(),
            amount_awarded = sum(amount_awarded)) %>%
  mutate(avg = amount_awarded/n)
```


```{r value-of-all-grants, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

theme_set(theme_bw())

p1 <- ggplot(df2 %>% top_frac(0.2, amount_awarded),
             aes(x = reorder(funding_org_name, -amount_awarded),
                 y = amount_awarded, fill = amount_awarded)) +

The plot below shows the average grant value from each funder, with the number of reported grants given by each funder.

```{r avg-grant-size, eval=FALSE}

p2 <- ggplot(df2 %>% top_frac(0.2, avg),
             aes(x = reorder(funding_org_name, -avg),

### Award sizes

In the two examples below, we can see differences between the amount of money applied for and the amount awarded. Not every funder reports the amount applied for, and some report what seem like placeholder values, such as grant programmes where applicants do not need to specify the value of the grant, only what they want to do and leave the award amount up to the funder. 

```{r award-differences, eval=FALSE}
proc_df <- tsg_process_data(grants) 

proc_amount_df <- proc_df  %>% 
  select(identifier, title, description, funding_org_name,
         amount_awarded, amount_applied_for) %>%
  mutate_at(.vars = vars(amount_awarded, amount_applied_for), as.numeric) %>% 
  mutate(difference = amount_awarded-amount_applied_for,
         percentage_of = amount_awarded/amount_applied_for) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(amount_applied_for), amount_applied_for > 2500,
         amount_awarded > 2500,
         percent_rank(difference) >= 0.02 &
           percent_rank(difference) <= 0.98) %>% ## remove outliers
  mutate(difference = round(difference))

count0 <- proc_amount_df %>%
  filter(difference==0) %>%
  tally()
  
p4 <- ggplot(proc_amount_df %>% filter(difference != 0),
             aes(x = difference)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(bins = 100) + 
  geom_label_repel(
    aes(x = 0, y = 4000,
        label = paste0(scales::comma(n),
                       " applications awarded exact amount applied for")),
    data = count0) + 
  scale_color_viridis_c() + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) + 
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format(prefix = "£"),
                     breaks = c(-20000, -10000, -5000, -2500,
                                0, 2500, 5000, 7500)) + 
  labs(x = "Difference between Award and Application Amount",
       y = "Number of Grants")

p4

```


```{r percentage awarded, eval=FALSE}
p5 <- ggplot(proc_amount_df %>%
               filter(difference != 0, percentage_of != Inf),
             aes(x = percentage_of)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(bins = 200) + 
  geom_label_repel(
    aes(x = 1, y = 3000, hjust = 1,
        label = paste0(scales::comma(n),
                       " applications awarded amount applied for")),
    data = count0) +

                     breaks = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75,0.9, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2)) + 
  labs(x = "Award size as percentage of amount applied for",
